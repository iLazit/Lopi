            [Yuerry]
            [Chorus]
            Where would I be if I didn’t have you?
            Probably 6 feet under after taking shots of booze
            Head stuck in the sand
            With nobody giving a damn
            You showed me the world in the palms of your hands 

            [Verse]
            I could never not say a “thank you”
            love is all I got to give 
            I wanna show appreciation for all that you did
            You made me feel alive you made me want to live life again
            You made me feel something
            You made me jump out of bed

            [Verse 2]
            And then I look at the mirror
            See something so bleak
            That face isn’t any clearer
            I’m staring at a freak
            “If only I could be her”
            My mind is telling me
            I just wanna look at the mirror
            And like what’s looking back at me

            [Chorus]
            Where would I be if I didn’t have you?
            Probably 6 feet under after taking shots of booze
            Head stuck in the sand
            With nobody giving a damn
            You showed me the world in the palms of your hands

            [Lil Qt]
            I say love lovelovelove
            I can give you my heart
            I dont wanna give you up
            I dont wanna mess this up
        
            They say love lovelovelove
            I say come live it up
            I can buy you the world
            Make sure that you been heard

            Love will follow wherever you go
            Divine my light is all  yours 
            Wishing it always
            Cruising it out the view

            You make my heart pound
            You make my dreams come true
